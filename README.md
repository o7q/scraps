A collection of my old/unfinished/scrapped projects.

**MediaConverter** 11/13/2022 \
A to-be command-line based media conversion suite. I scrapped it because I felt the command-line based system would be clunky and unintuitive. I am planning on making a GUI version. If that is already out then hello from the future!

**NSLookupTool** 9/5/2021 \
A *scary* iptool that allows you to geolocate and ping ip addresses. Now known as [**netutil**](https://github.com/o7q/netutil).

**BlueMoods** 2/24/2022 \
A joke virus I made with my friend. It makes blue emojis appear on the screen alongside silly sounds.

**chimichanga64** 12/28/2021 \
Another joke virus I made to troll my friend.
