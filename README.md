A collection of my random/scrapped/old projects.

## **Projects in order by date**
Builds are included, run them at your own risk! None of them do harm but some could be an annoyance. Projects with a `*` next to them are ones that could be annoying. (aka a fake virus/troll app)

**MediaConverter (old)** 11/13/2022 \
A to-be command-line based media conversion suite. I scrapped it because I felt the command-line based system would be clunky and unintuitive. I am planning on making a GUI version. If that is already out then hello from the future! \
