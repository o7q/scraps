## **Projects in order by date**
Builds are included, run them at your own risk! Some of them can do harm.

**MediaConverter** 11/13/2022 \
A to-be command-line based media conversion suite. I scrapped it because I felt the command-line based system would be clunky and unintuitive. I am planning on making a GUI version. If that is already out then hello from the future!

**c++game** 6/16/2022 \
My first C++ program.

**BlueMoods** 2/24/2022 \
A joke virus I made with my friend. It makes blue emojis appear on the screen alongside silly sounds.

**chimichanga64** 12/28/2021 \
Another joke virus I made to troll my friend.

**NSLookupTool** 9/5/2021 \
A *scary* iptool that allows you to geolocate and ping ip addresses. Now known as [**netutil**](https://github.com/o7q/netutil).
