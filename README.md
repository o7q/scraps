## **Projects in order by date**
Builds are included, run them at your own risk! None of them are dangerous but some do modify files. Files with a `*` next to them are ones that could possibly do harm.

**MediaConverter** 11/13/2022 \
A to-be command-line based media conversion suite. I scrapped it because I felt the command-line based system would be clunky and unintuitive. I am planning on making a GUI version. If that is already out then hello from the future! \
